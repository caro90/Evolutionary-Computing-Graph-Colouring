# Evolutionary Computing Graph Colouring

An implementation of an evolutionary algorithm, in particular a Genetic Local Search for solving the graph colouring problem. More specific the main points of the GLS algorithm are the following:

* Use of the partitioning representation of the graph colouring problem.
* A **Greedy Partitioning Crossover (GPX)**, to produce the offspring solutions.
* A **Vertex Descent Local Search (VDLS)** which is applied right after the GPX in order to improve the current solutions.
